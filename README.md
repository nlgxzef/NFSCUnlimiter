# NFSC Unlimiter
NFSC Unlimiter is an .asi mod which fixes some issues for added cars:
+ Added cars cannot be seen in game. (Increased CarTypeID limit and block size variables to solve the problem.)
+ Selecting added cars make the game crash. (Increased CarTypeID limit for RenderConn functions.)
- Cars over the limit, or models don't exist in CARS folder will get replaced with Porsche Carrera GT.
+ And more...
